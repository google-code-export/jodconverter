= Building from source =

== Subversion Repository ==

The latest JODConverter source code is available from the Subversion repository. To check out the library do:
{{{
svn checkout http://jodconverter.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/jodconverter-core jodconverter-core
}}}

To check out the sample webapp:
{{{
svn checkout http://jodconverter.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/jodconverter-sample-webapp jodconverter-sample-webapp
}}}

== Maven Build ==

JODConverter uses Maven 3 as its build tool, so it can be built in the usual Maven way. A Sigar native library is now required for compiling (although it's optional at runtime): download the right one for your system from [http://svn.hyperic.org/projects/sigar_bin/dist/SIGAR_1_6_5/lib/ svn.hyperic.org] and save it to a local dir.
{{{
cd jodconverter-core
mvn -Djava.library.path=/path/to/sigar/lib install
}}}
and you should have `jodconverter-core-3.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` in the target dir.

The OOo installation path can be explicitly specified with e.g.
{{{
mvn -Doffice.home=/usr/lib64/libreoffice -Djava.library.path=/path/to/sigar/lib install
}}}

If there are test failure, try skipping the tests (not a good practice but because of OOo integration failures may be due to timeout values rather than real issues):
{{{
mvn -DskipTests install
}}}

You can build a ZIP distribution package containing all library dependencies with:
{{{
mvn assembly:single
}}}
which should result in a file called `jodconverter-core-3.0-SNAPSHOT-dist.zip` in the target dir.
