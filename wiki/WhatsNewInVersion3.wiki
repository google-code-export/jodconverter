#summary What's New in Version 3.0

= New 3.0 Features =

Compared to JODConverter 2.x, version 3.0 will be a substantial rewrite of the code. The main focus will be on improving the reliability and scalability of working with an external OOo process. New features will include:

 * Manage (start/stop/restart) OOo instances from Java
 * Automatically restart an OOo instance if it crashes
 * Optionally use a pool of separate OOo instances
 * Abort conversions that take too long (according to a configurable timeout)
 * Automatically restart an OOo instance after n conversions (workaround for OOo memory leaks)

Additionally the new architecture will make it easier to use the core JODConverter classes as a generic framework for working with OOo - not just limited to document conversions.

As of the first beta, all features except OOo pooling have been implemented.
